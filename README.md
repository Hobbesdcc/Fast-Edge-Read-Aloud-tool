# Simple text input page for MS Edge Read Aloud Feature.


MS Egde's Read Aloud feature is great, but it can only read text from the html on a web page. It will not read user text they type into a text box. So this is a simple local web page just to have a place to copy text into a box, push a button and have it changed to a html paragraphs so Read aloud can read it.

## Steps:
1. Download the file "FastEdgeReadAloudTool.html"
3. Then open it in MS Edge. (drag and drop if its not yr default browser.)
4. Nice big box to copy text, then submit it to change the text to a html paragraph so Read Aloud can work.
5. You can even save the page in your bookmarks!

ps. The .bat file is just a script to open the html page in edge incase you want to make a desktop shortcut, but I'd suggest just making a bookmark to the file.
